          The Holy Scriptures are the inspired Word of God that brings hope to
          every living person. It is a lifetime manual for daily victorious
          living. Its authority is ultimate, final, and eternal. It cannot be
          added to or subtracted from, or superseded in any regard. It contains
          all that is needed for guidance in godliness and practical Christian
          conduct.

        <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
          God exists in perfect unity within Himself. He exists as one God in
          three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity
          of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His
          miracles, His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, His
          bodily resurrection, His ascension, and His imminent return in power
          and glory.

        <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
          The visible body of Christ is a vital part of Christianity, where we
          grow, flourish as we engage in serving, participate in corporate
          prayer, corporate worship, and form relationships. We are here to
          glorify God, proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, and build godly
          communities.

          Atonement and Salvation
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Christ's vicarious death on the cross paid the penalty for the sins of
          the whole world, but its benefits must be appropriated and are only
          applicable to those who believe and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord
          and Savior. Salvation is a free gift of God and not a result of our
          good works or any human effort. We believe the Lord Jesus Christ is
          the only one who can reconcile us to God; therefore, we must repent,
          have faith in Jesus Christ, submit to His will, and be saved by grace.

          Baptism and the Lord's Supper
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Baptism is the outward sign of what God has already done in the
          individual's life and is a testimony to all that the person now
          belongs to Jesus. It is identification with Jesus and is effected in
          the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and is done by
          immersion into water like our Lord Jesus Christ. The second baptism
          was given at Pentecost, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is the promise
          of the Father, sent by Jesus after His Ascension. Christians should
          seek to be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit.

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          The Lord’s Supper is a commemoration of the death of the Lord and is
          done in remembrance of Him until He comes again; it is a sign of our
          participation in Him. Both institutions are restricted to those who
          are believers.

        <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
          We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again as He
          promised, physically and visibly for the second time to establish His
          kingdom. This will occur at a date undisclosed by the Scriptures. We
          affirm the bodily, personal, second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,
          the resurrection of the saints, the millennium, and the final
          judgment. The final judgment will determine the eternal status of both
          the saints and the unbelievers, determined by their relationship to
          Jesus Christ. We affirm with the Bible the final state of the new
          heavens and the new earth.
